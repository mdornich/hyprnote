## What is Char?

Char is an AI notetaking app specifically designed to take meeting notes. With Char, you can transcribe all kinds of meetings whether it be online or offline.

- **Listens** to your meetings so you can only jot down important stuff
- **No bots** joining your meetings - Char listens directly to sounds coming in & out of your computer
- Crafts perfect **summaries** based on your memos, right after the meeting is over
- You can run Char completely **offline** by using LM Studio or Ollama

You can also use it for taking notes for lectures or organizing your thoughts.

brew install --cask fastrepl/hyprnote/hyprnote@nightly

## Highlights

### Notepad

Char is designed to take notes easily during meetings. Just jot down stuff you think are important!

### Realtime Transcript

While you stay engaged in the conversation, Char captures every detail so you don't have to type frantically.

### From Memos to Summaries

Once the meeting is over, Char will craft a personalized summary based on your memos — which is not mandatory. Char will still create great summaries without your notes.

### Truly Local

If you noticed the GIF above, you can see that Char works without any internet connection available. Just set up LM Studio or Ollama to operate Char in air-gapped environments!

### Bring Your Own LLM

Prefer something custom? You can swap in your own language model:

- Run local models via Ollama
- Use approved third-party APIs like Gemini, Claude, or Azure-hosted GPT
- Stay compliant with whatever your org allows

Char plays nice with whatever stack you're running.

### Note Templates

Prefer a certain style? Choose from predefined templates like bullet points, agenda-based, or paragraph summary. Or create your own.

### AI Chat

Ask follow-ups right inside your notes:

- "Rewrite this in simpler language"
- "Translate to Spanish"
